Benefits of this Framework:

Separation of Concerns - API logic is separate from test logic
Reusability - Clients can be reused across multiple tests
Maintainability - Changes to endpoints only need updates in one place
Configuration - Environment variables allow different settings per environment
Fixtures - Shared setup/teardown logic via pytest fixtures
